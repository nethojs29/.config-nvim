# Personal config for nvim

I'm starting to get into nvim so this are my first step towards making my own version of nvim.

So far so good tho, I had the iniciative to create a repo :>

## Prep

- Install nvim
- Have a node installation > 14.x.x for `markdown-preview.vin`

## Installation

Since it's based on lazyvim with only opening nvim it will get everything installed :D

## Troubles

For `neogit` I needed to enable the signature of the commits with a prompt in nvim.

I followed this [guide](https://sbulav.github.io/vim/neovim-signing-git-commits/) on work's mac.
